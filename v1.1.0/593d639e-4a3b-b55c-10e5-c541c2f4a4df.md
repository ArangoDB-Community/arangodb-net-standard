# PostCursorOptions Properties
 

The <a href="33e10911-ea6c-31b3-60fc-c57350209014">PostCursorOptions</a> type exposes the following members.


## Properties
&nbsp;<table><tr><th></th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="c79a6124-0642-617f-1407-75c14fbc8bb0">FailOnWarning</a></td><td>
When set to true, the query will throw an exception and abort instead of producing a warning. This option should be used during development to catch potential issues early. When the attribute is set to false, warnings will not be propagated to exceptions and will be returned with the query result. There is also a server configuration option --query.fail-on-warning for setting the default value for failOnWarning so it does not need to be set on a per-query level.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="d680d789-d99c-0878-6a41-4ad7b04a7377">FullCount</a></td><td>
If set to true and the query contains a LIMIT clause, then the result will have an extra attribute with the sub-attributes stats and fullCount, { ... , "extra": { "stats": { "fullCount": 123 } } }. The fullCount attribute will contain the number of documents in the result before the last top-level LIMIT in the query was applied. It can be used to count the number of documents that match certain filter criteria, but only return a subset of them, in one go. It is thus similar to MySQLâ€™s SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS hint. Note that setting the option will disable a few LIMIT optimizations and may lead to more documents being processed, and thus make queries run longer. Note that the fullCount attribute may only be present in the result if the query has a top-level LIMIT clause and the LIMIT clause is actually used in the query.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="e6f70e21-83ce-6b40-ed00-67746ae9e8e5">IntermediateCommitCount</a></td><td>
Maximum number of operations after which an intermediate commit is performed automatically. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="74f8e103-4578-3bc1-5f7e-96fadf753c1a">IntermediateCommitSize</a></td><td>
Maximum total size of operations after which an intermediate commit is performed automatically. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="492402ac-9477-1b85-0051-7afed4c3821b">MaxPlans</a></td><td>
Limits the maximum number of plans that are created by the AQL query optimizer.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="d2823fa9-a806-ab0e-bd04-d1f83d7ed651">MaxRuntime</a></td><td>
The query has to be executed within the given runtime or it will be killed. The value is specified in seconds. A value of 0 means no timeout will be enforced. The default value is 0 (no timeout). Available in ArangoDB 3.6 onwards.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="42c0579c-5a53-2e0d-015b-959529113242">MaxTransactionSize</a></td><td>
Transaction size limit in bytes. Honored by the RocksDB storage engine only.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="a8e3cd96-cf7b-ae31-35a7-b2b52999adb2">MaxWarningCount</a></td><td>
Limits the maximum number of warnings a query will return. The number of warnings a query will return is limited to 10 by default, but that number can be increased or decreased by setting this attribute.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="31edcbd1-4bb7-a0c5-2c27-60d356efe127">Optimizer</a></td><td>
A list of to-be-included or to-be-excluded optimizer rules can be put into the <a href="5e666775-3ccc-cf06-decd-2bb95e8b30c6">Rules</a> attribute, telling the optimizer to include or exclude specific rules. To disable a rule, prefix its name with a -, to enable a rule, prefix it with a +. There is also a pseudo-rule all, which will match all optimizer rules.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="46bb3b4d-befc-d5d3-b400-3fba10e8c85b">Profile</a></td><td>
If set to true or 1, then the additional query profiling information will be returned in the sub-attribute profile of the extra return attribute, if the query result is not served from the query cache. Set to 2 the query will include execution stats per query plan node in sub-attribute stats.nodes of the extra return attribute. Additionally the query plan is returned in the sub-attribute extra.plan.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="c4c87eb7-a684-3de7-caf0-3ca07b71bb87">SatelliteSyncWait</a></td><td>
This Enterprise Edition parameter allows to configure how long a DBServer will have time to bring the satellite collections involved in the query into sync. The default value is 60.0 (seconds). When the max time has been reached the query will be stopped.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="b6da9690-e88b-4a11-685c-16dde0c3f033">SkipInaccessibleCollections</a></td><td>
AQL queries (especially graph traversals) will treat collection to which a user has no access rights as if these collections were empty. Instead of returning a forbidden access error, your queries will execute normally. This is intended to help with certain use-cases: A graph contains several collections and different users execute AQL queries on that graph. You can now naturally limit the accessible results by changing the access rights of users on collections. This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public property](media/pubproperty.gif "Public property")</td><td><a href="def83dad-fe68-74d2-ebd7-c9fc8980c7d9">Stream</a></td><td>
Specify true and the query will be executed in a streaming fashion. The query result is not stored on the server, but calculated on the fly. Beware: long-running queries will need to hold the collection locks for as long as the query cursor exists. When set to false a query will be executed right away in its entirety. In that case query results are either returned right away (if the result set is small enough), or stored on the arangod instance and accessible via the cursor API (with respect to the ttl). It is advisable to only use this option on short-running queries or without exclusive locks (write-locks on MMFiles). Please note that the query options cache, count and fullCount will not work on streaming queries. Additionally query statistics, warnings and profiling data will only be available after the query is finished. The default value is false</td></tr></table>&nbsp;
